# coursera-fullstack1-frontend-bootstrap

This repository contains a simple website for the restaurant "Ristorante Con Fusion". It is created to store the completed code for practices in the first course of the Coursera Full Stack Specialization. The main focus of this course is on the frontend using HTML3, CSS5 and JS. The Bootstrap 4 framework was adopted to design the website.

To see the website in action:

1. Clone this repo
2. `npm install` (_to install npm dependencies_)
3. `npm start` (_to start local web server_)
